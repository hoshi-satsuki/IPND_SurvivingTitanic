I did a first analysis on the titanic data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).  
This repo contains the jupyter notebook, the corresponding html file and the yml file containing the information on the libraries used.  
While performing the analysis I used the Python and Pandas documentation and, of course, stack overflow and wikipedia.
This project has been part of the Introduction to Programming Nanodegree on Udacity.
